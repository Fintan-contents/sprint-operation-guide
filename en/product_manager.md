# Product managers

## Role

The role of product owner has the role of product manager plus an extra. Contract development does not have a role that is analogous to the stereotypical product owner, so for the purposes of contract development, we have used the term "product manager".

When iterative development is done within discrete phases, a safety lead is needed, so in most cases, the need to implement stories needs to be assessed before agreeing on any points with the client during scheduling. 
It is the product manager’s responsibility to find hotspots and ensure that the team carries out design work according to the general OCP rules to ensure that anything created before this point is not wasted.
