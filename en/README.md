## Basic rules and premise

The basic rules and premise of team operations are as follows.  

### Premise
- A scrum team consists of a product owner, scrum master and development team.
   - For contract development, a [product manager](./product_manager.md) takes the place of a product owner.
- It is presumed that the development team has 7±2 members.
- It is recommended to carry out tasks in pairs.
   - This is not to force teams to use pair programming but to ensure sufficient accuracy in quality checks and completion checks.
   - However, pair programming is strongly recommended for the tasks that is difficult or implemented for the first time. 


### Operational procedures
- Create an [overall plan](./sprints_planning.md).
- Carry out the project according to the [procedures](./rhythm.md).
- [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md)
